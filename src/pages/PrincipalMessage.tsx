                  Welcome to Fortune World School! Inspired by the words of Sydney J. Harris, we believe that education should be a window to new vistas and new opportunities for each child. Being the Principal of this school, I am enthusiastic about sharing with you how we strive to make learning a rewarding experience beyond the four walls of the classroom.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">

We are committed to providing a stimulating, invigorating, and supportive learning environment that will help foster inquiry, creativity, critical thinking, and lifelong learning among students. Our objective is to transform "mirrors" of knowledge into "windows" that open up a vista of opportunities.

Our highly esteemed faculty members-merchants of passion and experience in teaching-will ensure that each student travels his or her unique educational journey to be prepared and equipped to enter the future with confidence and curiosity.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  We also acknowledge the importance of growth and development through a more holistic approach. We support our academic programs with extracurricular activities, such as sports, arts, community service, and character-building activities, which further develop the many talents of our students.
